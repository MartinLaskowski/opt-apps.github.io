Fast, large-scale mathematical optimization models drive our stock markets, route ambulances, fly drones, aim space telescopes and supply electricity: **Optimization is important and beautiful**. 

After six years at AMPL Optimization, Inc., I now consult on creation, speeding, reformulation, translation and integration of optimization applications into modern decision and real-time systems.

I also engage on a pro bono basis for the right teams and causes, because **optimization is important and beautiful**, and should be accessible to people working to make the world better. Nemo vir est qui mundum non reddat meliorem.
